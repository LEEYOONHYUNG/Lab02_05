1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.
The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.


2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
SSH key pair works to identify an user to Github. It helps us to identify ourselves without explicitly using password of username during the process. 
To use SSH key pair, we need two keys which are private key and public key. 
As the name suggests, private key is only kept in my local computer, while public key is shared to public like github. SSH key is very similar to RSA encryption. 
After manipulating with some git keywords, we can generate id_rsa_.pub file which will be used as a public key.
