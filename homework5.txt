2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.
>>> An SSH key is an alternate way to identify ourselves that doesn't require us to enter us username and password everytime. Because we'll often need to identify ourselves to Github, we use SSH key instead of username, password. 
SSH keys come in pairs, a public key and a private key. If the keys match, we're granted access.
