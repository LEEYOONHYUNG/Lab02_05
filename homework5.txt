1. What is .gitignore? You can write the answer either in Korean or English.

.gitignore is a file to ignore some files or directories. When I want to commit&push some changes in my local repository, I can exclude some files written in .gitignore. Especially, when many people use one repository, .gitignore can invent conflict problem in pull request.

2. Why do Github users need an SSH key pair? (Users can use either SSH key pair or github account info.) Please write down a brief explanation of SSH key.

When I use GitHub, only authorized users can push to my repository. Only authorized user who authenticated SSH Key can access my reposity. Therefore, SSH Key is really necessary in GitHub It is similar to Public Key Authentication in Linux. 
There is Public Key and Private Key in SSH KEY. id_rsa.pub is Public Key and id_rsa is Private Key. To be an authorized user, we had better register Public Key in Github.

Thanks!
